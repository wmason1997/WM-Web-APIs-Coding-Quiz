# WM-Web-APIs-Coding-Quiz

## Description ##


## Credits ##
I modeled this Web APIs Coding Quiz project after the solved 28-Stu-Mini-Project in the 04-Web-APIs folder of UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC GitLab repository.

I used ChatGPT for help to write my displayQuestion() function.

I had a tutoring session with Sandy Smith on Saturday 10/28/2023. They helped me with hiding the game-end-button and highscores-display divs until when I wanted them to display as dictated by the JavaScript. We spent about 20 minutes on the 1 second discrepancy but moved on when we we realized we were not making progress and I had other questions.

At a certain point, I realized I would have to order the highscores in descending order by score so I Googled it and consulted [https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_array_sort.asp) and [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/sort) to do that in my highscoresOrder() function.

# WM-Web-APIs-Coding-Quiz

## Description ##


## Credits ##
I modeled this Web APIs Coding Quiz project after the solved 28-Stu-Mini-Project in the 04-Web-APIs folder of UCSD-VIRT-FSF-PT-09-2023-U-LOLC GitLab repository.

I used ChatGPT for help to write my displayQuestion() function.

I had a tutoring session with Sandy Smith on Saturday 10/28/2023. They helped me with hiding the game-end-button and highscores-display divs until when I wanted them to display as dictated by the JavaScript. We spent about 20 minutes on the 1 second discrepancy but moved on when we we realized we were not making progress and I had other questions.
